/**
This is a sample code I used to learn how to deal with sockets on C language.

The material I used as reference will be listed on this section:

First, for learning the basis I used this slide pres:

http://net.pku.edu.cn/~course/cs501/2011/code/BSD_Socket.t/sockets.pdf

It mentions about the socket API. I noticed it has few things in common with the python code I created on other project also hosted on this github.
